      <article>
        <p>After graduating with a bachelor's degree in Business from Univserity of California, Riverside,
           I worked in the climbing industry for the last 3 years. I had applied to many Information Systems Analyst positions during this time.
           Unfortunately, I never made it past the interview section due to my lack of experience. I was accepted into the LA High Tech Bridge and Coding Boot Camp 2.0 program.
          During my participation, I realized my high interest in front end web development.
          I have always had an affinity towards problem solving. I love working out my brain.
